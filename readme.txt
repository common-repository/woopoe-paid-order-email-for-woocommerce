WooPoe - Paid Order Email for WooCommerce sends an additional e-mail notification to the seller when the order has been paid.

== Description ==

WooPoe - Paid Order Email for WooCommerce simply sends an additional e-mail notification to the seller when an order has been paid, aka when it's moved to Process status.

By default, WooCommerce sends an e-mail to the buyer, but it does not allow to add other addresses to that mail.

With WooPoe:

*   An additional 'Paid Order' e-mail template is created under WooCommerce -> Settings -> Email
*   Here you'll be able to add multiple recipients, change title and description of the email
*   That's it, simple but effective
*   Tested up to WooCommerce 2.6.x

1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the WooCommerce Settings -> Email panel to edit the email and recipients
